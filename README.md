Game Show App

In this project, I've created a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

Using Javascript, I created an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, I've removed one of the player’s 5 guesses.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, it becomes disabled.

This was my first project using JavaScript and it was a great introduction into functions, strings, variables and loops.
